Notes on the application:

- The app starts up on the "FTDI screen"
- The pushbuttons on the daughterboard are used to switch screens
- Note that a few of the screens take a significant number of seconds to actually show up
- The difference in loading time is one of the points of the demonstration 
- For fun, the second FTDI screen is made with a little dot which is touch-tagged
  Touching the little dot causes the app to go back to the first screen with the larger dot
  as a confirmation that the touch works.
