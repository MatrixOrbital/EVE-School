// This file acts as a header for the .ino file.  Since the .ino file is the hardware abstraction layer
// in Arduino world, it also contains prototypes for abstracted hardware calls in addition to prototypes
// for abstracted time functions which in other compilers would just be other .c and .h files

// An abstraction layer is a translation between one thing and another.  In C it would consist of a pair of files
// - one with code and one with just the names of available functions (prototypes).  The names of the functions as 
// advertised in the header file are chosen by you to be as standard in your world as possible.  That way, all
// your higher level application code can make use of the same standardly named functions.  This abstraction layer
// then "calls" the actual base code and returns values in your own standard way.  An abstraction layer typically 
// does very little beyond calling the base function and returning it's results.  This way all your nice working 
// code can remain untouched and this abstraction layer becomes essentially a part of the project for a particular 
// target processor or compiler. 
//
// This file is appropriately called Arduino_AL.h since this is the abstraction layer, however our associated code 
// file should be called Arduino_AL.cpp for clarity.  Because this is Arduino, it must have a .ino suffix in order 
// to be able to make use of built in (or easily included) base functions because they are all C++.  As a result, 
// the .ino file also takes on the role of defining the abstraction layer between Arduino and any library of C or 
// C++ code - specifically without the necessity to "Arduinofy" code which may have been perfectly fine and tested 
// where and how it was.
//
// So, follows are function prototypes for functions found in the .ino file whatever it might be called.  Each of
// these functions simply calls the Arduino base function and returns the results where appropriate.  Wrappers.
